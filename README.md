# kglobalaccel-patch-ovveride-alttab-shortcut

Since for some reason in Plasma 5 you can't selectively disable shortcuts for applications, and that is annoying, I reuploaded this patch from here https://mattiesworld.gotdns.org/weblog/2018/05/09/quick-kde-kwin-hack-ignore-global-shortcuts-except-alt-tab/ in order to get at least alt+tab fully functional

I use ubuntu and this should be added when building the deb packages, download the package source for kglobalaccel, add the patch in debian/patches/ and the patch name in debian/patches/series
